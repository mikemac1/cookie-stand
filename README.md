## Comments & Reflections Lab 06

* How did this go, overall?
To be honest I am shocked. I expected to take all day and night and not get done, submitting only the work done for partial credit. But not only did I get it done and get almost all of it done without help (minus a small piece of getting the list items to all display) but I was able to get a couple of the CSS styles knocked out as well. I stuck with it and got it done. I'm really happy!!!

* What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?
I can see how the DOM is a real steep learning curve from just what I searched online this past weekend and today. I'm working on trying to find an alternative source of info like W3 to substitute for MDN. The JS pages in MDN really get convoluted and can bog me down with terminology and examples I just don't understand.

* How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
IT took me almost 3.5 hours to complete but definitely expected this to go well into the night before I started. One thing I did was try to write pseudo code about what I needed to do before I started.  It definitely helped however between Sheyna's examples and the lack of complexity it went pretty smooth.
