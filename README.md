## Lab 06/07/08b/09

## Problem Domain

10 October - Creating a site called Salmon Cookies that will take place over 5 days. It will consist of a home page (`index.html`) and a sales page (`sales.html`). First step is building out objects for the sales page from content derived from a JS file.
11 October - Today required the creation of a constructor which the cities' sales objects would be invoked from. Also the sales data will be funneled into a table displaying the hour totals for each city and combined as well as the totals for the day. Each city's data had to be rendered separately as part of the table.
12 October - Built out a low-fidelity wireframe with the seven photos and worked on applying it to the index.html page to include the requirements of adding seven images and locations with addresses, hours open, and contact information.
13 October - Build a form to accept the values for a new store location with sales data to include updating the table all done on the SALES page.

## Comments & Reflections Lab 06

* How did this go, overall?
To be honest I am shocked. I expected to take all day and night and not get done, submitting only the work done for partial credit. But not only did I get it done and get almost all of it done without help (minus a small piece of getting the list items to all display) but I was able to get a couple of the CSS styles knocked out as well. I stuck with it and got it done. I'm really happy!!!

* What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?
I can see how the DOM is a real steep learning curve from just what I searched online this past weekend and today. I'm working on trying to find an alternative source of info like W3 to substitute for MDN. The JS pages in MDN really get convoluted and can bog me down with terminology and examples I just don't understand.

* How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
It took me almost 3.5 hours to complete but definitely expected this to go well into the night before I started. One thing I did was try to write pseudo code about what I needed to do before I started.  It definitely helped however between Sheyna's examples and the lack of complexity it went pretty smooth.

## Comments & Reflections Lab 07

* How did this go, overall?
Two wins in a row and I am REALLY happy. Like yesterday I expected to take all day and night to get this done. The difference is I spent more time redoing what I did yesterday but coming out better in the end because I was able to slim my code down and really get the gist of what the constructor is doing.  Also the table functions I created for the thead, tbody, and tfoot had one small snag in the tfoot but was easy to clear up when an array of the cities was created.  It honestly feels good to have a plan and stick to it with elements I learned today. Just need to keep moving forward.

* What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?
Definitely made another jump with learning today but the syntax is really the hard part in getting right. The other piece is I need to do a much better job in writing succinct functions. I can see I am doing rework because my functions are including huge chunks of code that do not need to be there. I know it takes practice but the main part I am trying to take away is the functions are working.

* How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
It took me a little over 3 hours to complete but like last night I definitely expected this to go well into the night to get finished. Again, writing pseudo code I think is what is saving me.

## Comments & Reflections Lab 08b

* How did this go, overall
Funny how when you get into a project how fast time flies by. I worked this for more time than I did with lab 08a. It was more so playing with the CSS settings for the different items to see how it would look and to play with what I wanted to end up with. I did a quick low-fidelity wireframe to start with and then just played with the margins and width to give the index.html page to fit all the photos. Overall it didn't go bad at all and since I can't mix colors to save my life I just had fun with it.

* What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?
Again, like a lot of other pieces I just need to practice to get an idea of how sizes work on the screen. I started with what Sheyna used for the demo this morning and went from there. When I realized I was spending more time to re-size the photos to fit I knew I needed to move on.

* How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
I took about 2 hours to complete the assignment and I guess that is the estimate I had. To be honest though, I really didn't put a whole lot of thought into the amount of time it was going to take as I just took the lab as one of practice, not to make it perfect.  This thought process is probably something I should take for more projects so I am not stressed out.
